Onion Architecture Implementation
This repository demonstrates the implementation of Onion Architecture in a .NET Core application. Onion Architecture is a software design pattern that aims to address common issues with traditional layered architecture, focusing on separation of concerns and maintainability.

Features:
Clear separation between application layers (Core, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation).
Dependency Injection for better testability and flexibility.
Domain-driven design approach for business logic and entities.
Sample implementation of a real-world scenario to show the architecture in action.
Layers:
Core: Contains the domain entities, interfaces, and business logic.
Application: Handles use cases, services, and application-specific logic.
Infrastructure: Implements data access, external services, and any other external dependencies.
Presentation: The user interface layer (could be a Web API, MVC, etc.).
Setup:
Clone the repository.
Build the solution using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI.
Run the application and explore the structure.
Contributing:
Feel free to fork the repository, open issues, and submit pull requests.
